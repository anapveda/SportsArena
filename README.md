# Sports Arena Service

The **Sports Arena Service** is a Spring Boot microservice responsible for managing **sports arenas and their associated courts**. It integrates with the **Court Service** to assign and fetch courts, and with the **User Service** to get the logged-in userâ€™s location for nearest arena recommendations.

It also uses **JWT authentication**, propagates tokens via Feign interceptors, and enforces **role-based authorization**.
